Pong written in JavaFx. Check source for PongSinglePlayer.java for references &amp; inspirations. Will upload a networked version of this program for human vs. human multiplayer in the near future.

If you want to run the game, go to the builds folder and download the appropriate executable jar file. 
Please note that you will have to have java installed on your computer.
